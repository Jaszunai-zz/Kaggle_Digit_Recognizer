# Kaggle_Digit_Recognizer
Kaggle is hosting a machine learning competition for beginners in computer vision using the MNIST dataset. This dataset contains numerous images of handwritten digits, presented as 28 by 28 pixel images. We are tasked with creating a model that can look at the image and correctly identify what digit is displayed in the image. https://www.kaggle.com/c/digit-recognizer

I created a convolutional neural network that achieved an accuracy of 99% on an unseen testset.
